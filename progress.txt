- Next priority is US-011: Chunking per PDF lunghi

---

## 2026-01-25 - US-011: Chunking per PDF lunghi

### What was done:
- Added text chunking functionality to lib/openrouter.ts for handling long PDFs
- Created `estimateTokens(text)` function that estimates tokens (~4 chars/token)
- Created `chunkText(text, maxTokens)` function that intelligently splits text:
  - First tries to split at paragraph boundaries (double newlines)
  - Falls back to sentence boundaries if paragraphs are too long
  - Falls back to word boundaries as last resort
  - Default max is 3000 tokens (safe for free models)
- Created `generateSummaryWithChunking(text, detailLevel, maxTokens, onProgress)` function:
  - Automatically detects if text needs chunking
  - Generates summary for each chunk individually
  - Combines partial summaries using AI for coherent output
  - Falls back to concatenated summaries if AI combining fails
  - Supports progress callback for UI updates
- Added `getCombinePrompt()` helper for the combining step
- Exported `ChunkProgressCallback` type for progress tracking
- Typecheck passes successfully

### Files created/modified:
- lib/openrouter.ts (updated - added chunking functionality)

### Notes for next developer:
- For long PDFs, use `generateSummaryWithChunking()` instead of `generateSummary()`
- Import: `import { generateSummaryWithChunking, chunkText, estimateTokens, ChunkProgressCallback } from '@/lib/openrouter'`
- The progress callback receives (current, total) for showing "Elaborando parte X di Y"
- If combined summaries are small enough (< 1.5x maxTokens), they're returned directly without AI combining
- If AI combining fails, concatenated summaries are returned with dividers as fallback
- Next priority is US-012: API route per generazione riassunto

---

## 2026-01-25 - US-012: API route per generazione riassunto

- Proper error handling with user-friendly Italian error messages
- Typecheck passes successfully

### Files created/modified:
- app/api/summarize/route.ts (new - API endpoint for PDF summarization)

### Notes for next developer:
- The API uses FormData for file upload, not JSON
- To call this API from the frontend, use `new FormData()` and append file, excludePages, detailLevel
- Example: `formData.append('file', pdfFile); formData.append('detailLevel', 'medium');`
- The summaryId can be used to navigate to /summary/[id] page (US-013)
- User authentication will be added in US-024 to associate summaries with logged-in users
- Next priority is US-013: Pagina risultato riassunto

---

## 2026-01-25 - US-013: Pagina risultato riassunto

  - API error handling with styled error message display
  - Connected "Genera Riassunto" button to handleSubmit function
- Full API integration: creates FormData, calls /api/summarize, redirects to /summary/[id]
- Smooth animations using Tailwind CSS transition classes
- Typecheck passes successfully

### Files created/modified:
- components/progress-indicator.tsx (new - ProgressIndicator component with stage support)
- app/upload/page.tsx (updated - added processing state, API call, progress indicator integration)

### Notes for next developer:
- Import the component: `import { ProgressIndicator, ProgressStage } from '@/components/progress-indicator'`
- ProgressStage type is "analyzing" | "generating" | "chunking" | "saving"
- The chunking stage supports a progress object: `{ current: number, total: number }`
- The actual chunking progress from OpenRouter isn't streamed to the client (would require SSE/WebSocket)
- For now, client simulates stage transitions; server-side streaming could be added later
- Error messages from the API are displayed with a styled red error box
- The page automatically redirects to /summary/[summaryId] on success

- Import PDF generator: `import { generateSummaryPdf } from '@/lib/pdf-generator'`
- The function takes SummaryPdfData object with title, pdfName, detailLevel, createdAt, content
- Markdown is converted to plain text - complex formatting is simplified
- PDF uses Helvetica font (built into jsPDF, no external fonts needed)
- The sanitized filename removes special characters and limits to 50 chars
